  abstract = {In this paper a general method is given for reconstruction of a set
	of feature points in an arbitrary dimensional projective space from
	their projections into lower dimensional spaces. The method extends
	the methods applied in the well-studied problem of reconstruction
	of a set of scene points in given their projections in a set of images.
	In this case, the bifocal, trifocal and quadrifocal tensors are used
	to carry out this computation. It is shown that similar methods will
	apply in a much more general context, and hence may be applied to
	projections from to , which have been used in the analysis of dynamic
	scenes. For sufficiently many generic projections, reconstruction
	of the scene is shown to be unique up to projectivity, except in
	the case of projections onto one-dimensional image spaces (lines).},

	e.g. in known coplanarities or parallelities among points in the
	scene, or known positions of some focal points (hand-eye calibration).
	Despite unknown camera calibrations, it is shown that in many instances
	the subsidiary information makes affine or even Euclidean reconstruction
	possible. A parametrization by affine shape and depth is used, providing
	a simple framework for the incorporation of apriori knowledge, and
	enabling the development of iterative, rapidly converging algorithms.
	Any number of points in any number of images are used in a uniform
	way, with equal priority, and independently of coordinate representations.
	Moreover, occlusions are allowed.},
